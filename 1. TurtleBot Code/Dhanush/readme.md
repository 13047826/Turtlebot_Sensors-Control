### Steps to search and detect leader turtlebot <br>

1. Create a class for the movement
2. Define properties
3. Account for connecting to ROS and setting up subscribers/publishers
4. Implement search mode (scanning for leader)
5. Capture RGB/Depth images
6. Use SURF for feature detection
7. Identify leader
8. Rotate follower turtlebot to leader turtlebot via states
9. Factor in variables such as angle, velocity, distance
10. Consider distance maintained between follower and leader
11. Think of possible collision avoidance that can be used in the environment
12. Check that ROS is publishing/subscribing correctly
13. Test system, observe and make adjustments to code
