The following code:
1. Uses a camera class to store information
2. Uses image processing to detect the corners and centre of blue square feature
3. Uses interpolation to calculate the distance from the camera to the feature by comparing to a calibration target matrix
4. WILL use PID control to dynamically control linear and angular velocities
